This is my first [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It serves as my own blog & diary platform which you can check here [https://niemal.dev/blog](https://niemal.dev/blog).

## Getting Started

First you should edit `config.json` with your local area network IP i.e. `192.168.1.180`. Then you can:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://lan-ip:3000](http://lan-ip:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Production
Edit the `clean_tests.sh` with the information you seem necessary and proceed to build and deploy (I run my own with [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) and [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)).
