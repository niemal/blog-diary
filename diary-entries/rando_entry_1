This is a random entry. Lorem ipsum yeah ayy lmao. We can “refer” to the node of the ref created in the render method with access to the current attribute of the ref. From the example above, that would be this.exampleRef.current.
createRef() is a new API that shipped with React 16.3. You can create a ref by calling React.createRef() and attaching a React element to it using the ref attribute on the element.
The rest of this post will get into refs, which is all still relevant in the what and why of refs.
